# QA-Automation-Hillel
My home work 1
I have a desire to develop as a QA.
Working in manual testing, I understand that I have reached the limit and I need to develop further.
My skills that I will receive thanks to the course are relevant for the project where I work, as well as in the IT market.
And I am sure that after completing the course I will be able to consolidate my knowledge on my project and after 3-6 months I will be able to work more confidently as Automation QA Engineer.
I hope that the course will be interesting and rich!
